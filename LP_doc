Assumptions

Data comparability: Training and production populations remain comparable after consent filtering, deduplication, and timestamp integrity checks; no post-outcome signals leak into features used for training or scoring.​

Stationarity bounds: Feature and label distributions may drift within monitored thresholds; exceeding thresholds triggers recalibration or refresh per the lifecycle policy to preserve calibration and lift.​

Actionability and ethics: Each propensity band and time-to-convert window maps to an approved treatment; scores guide prioritization and experimentation, not deterministic approvals or denials, with privacy constraints consistently applied.​

Business inputs

Conversion horizon: 90-day conversion window is the authoritative baseline for all performance metrics, thresholds, and reporting views; any changes require governance approval.

Existing customers: For known customers, service engagement history (e.g., recent service visits, tickets, interactions) may be used as directional input to inform treatment strategies, subject to consent, privacy, and model feature policies.

Bands and SLAs: Decile cut points, time-window classes (within 3, 7, 15, 30, >30 days), and channel SLAs are owned and approved by sales/marketing to align with capacity, budget, and customer experience goals.

Exception handling

Data intake exceptions: If required fields, consent flags, or schemas are missing, route records to a quarantine queue; log source, timestamp, and field list, and proceed only with a documented fallback or safe “do not score” status.​

Scoring pipeline exceptions: Guard preprocessing and inference; on step failure, capture context, return a safe default, continue batch processing, and page the responsible owner to avoid pipeline-wide halts.​

Model/service unavailability: Auto-degrade to the last certified model version; if no backup exists, apply business-defined fallback treatment for the affected segment until service restoration.​

Calibration or banding errors: If calibration artifacts or band definitions are invalid or missing, block promotion, revert to the last valid configuration, and notify governance for remediation before resuming scoring.​

Partner/branch anomalies: On partner feed spikes, duplicate bursts, or branch outages, trigger protective rules—rate-limit or defer scoring for the cohort, flag for review, and re-enable post-validation.​
