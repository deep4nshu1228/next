Final Propensity Score Calculation LogicIdentify Unique LeadsUse mobile number as the unique identifier for each lead.A lead can come from one or more sources:DigitalWalk-inTelephonySource-Based WeightageDigital: 5%Telephony: 5%Walk-in: 15%Multiple Source HandlingIf a mobile number has multiple leads from different sources, then:Find the maximum propensity score among all those leads.Take 75% of this maximum score as the base score.For each additional source (present for that same mobile number), add the corresponding percentage of the maximum score as per weightage.Score Calculation FormulaLet:[ P_{\text{max}} ] = Maximum propensity score for the mobile number[ W_{\text{digital}} = 0.05 ][ W_{\text{telephony}} = 0.05 ][ W_{\text{walkin}} = 0.15 ][ S ] = set of sources for that mobile numberFinal Propensity Score:Note:[ S_{\text{additional}} ] means all other sources apart from the one where [ P_{\text{max}} ] came from.If thereâ€™s only one source, the score = [ P_{\text{max}} ] (no 75% rule applied).ExampleMobile Number: 9876543210Leads:Digital: 0.62Walk-in: 0.78Telephony: 0.55[ P_{\text{max}} = 0.78] (Walk-in)Base score = [ 0.75 \times 0.78 = 0.585 ]Additional sources: Digital (5%), Telephony (5%)Extra = [ 0.05 \times 0.78 + 0.05 \times 0.78 = 0.039 + 0.039 = 0.078 ]Final Score = [ 0.585 + 0.078 = 0.663 ]
