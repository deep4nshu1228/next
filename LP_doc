Non-Digital enquiries propensity model

Overview

Purpose: Predict conversion likelihood for non-digital enquiries—walk-ins and telephonic enquiries—so teams can route to the right agents, set SLA targets, and tailor offline nurturing to maximize close rates with efficient use of branch capacity.

Decisions: Agent assignment and escalation, appointment/demo prioritization, outreach cadence selection, and branch-level staffing and follow-up SLAs driven by score bands and expected time-to-convert.

Population and scope

In-scope: Leads captured at physical locations (showrooms, dealerships, events) and via inbound/outbound phone interactions that are recorded in CRM/CCaaS with consent and sufficient identifiers for outcomes tracking.

Exclusions: Missing consent, insufficient identifiers, duplicate enquiries across channels, and records lacking minimal interaction detail to protect integrity, compliance, and actionability.

Outcome and labeling

Target: Conversion within a defined window (e.g., 30–60 days) confirmed via CRM; apply timestamped joins and leakage controls (e.g., no post-outcome features in training) to ensure clean supervision.

Label integrity: Standardize branch and call-center timestamps, enforce unique enquiry IDs, and audit deduplication of repeat visits or callbacks to prevent inflated performance from double-counting.

Feature design

Interaction signals: First-contact channel (walk-in vs. phone), enquiry recency/frequency, talk time, hold/transfers, callback latency, appointment scheduled, and no-show history capturing intent and friction.

Agent/branch context: Agent tenure and performance tiers, queue length at contact time, branch traffic load, hours/daypart, and regional seasonality reflecting operational conditions that shape conversion.

Prospect profile: Product interest, budget bracket if captured, location distance to branch, prior service history, and eligibility flags to separate high-likelihood enquiries from general footfall.

Model approach

Algorithms: Supervised propensity model for tabular data with imbalance handling; selection guided by AUC, PR-AUC, lift at top deciles, and calibration to support routing and SLA decisions with reliable probability estimates.

Validation: Time-aware splits with segment cuts by branch, region, agent tier, daypart, and enquiry type; holdout evaluation vs. historical baseline to set thresholds and ensure fair generalization across branches.

Scale, bands, and time-to-convert classes

Unified scale: Scores on a 0–1 scale mapped to deciles and operational bands (High, Medium, Low) consistent with other channels for unified reporting and playbooks.

Estimated conversion time: Classify leads into conversion windows—within 3 days, within 7 days, 15 days, 30 days, and more than 30 days—to align urgency, appointment scheduling, and follow-up cadence with expected time-to-close.

Action playbook examples

High propensity, 0–3 days: Senior-agent routing or manager callback, same-day appointment or test ride/demo, and tailored offer; trigger inventory hold or priority slot where applicable to accelerate close.

Medium propensity, 7–15 days: Structured follow-up plan with reminders, value-focused content, and scheduled check-ins; offer flexible appointment options and light incentives to move consideration forward.

Low propensity, 30+ days: Cost-conscious offline touches, periodic check-ins, and recycle rules; focus front-line capacity on higher bands while preserving long-tail opportunities at minimal cost.

Performance and monitoring

Reporting: AUC/PR-AUC, lift at top 10–30%, conversion by decile, calibration plots, and branch/agent-segment cuts to guide routing, staffing, and threshold tuning.

Monitoring: Track production vs. historical baseline for conversion by decile, lift, calibration drift, treatment compliance, and branch-level drift; alerts trigger playbook adjustments, coaching, or retraining as needed.

Operations and refresh

Cadence: Regular model refresh to incorporate seasonality, staffing changes, and monitoring learnings; re-calibrate thresholds and band-specific SLAs to sustain accuracy and operational lift over time.

Governance: Privacy and consent controls for call recordings and in-branch data, feature and version audit trails, documented limitations and misuse warnings, and clear rollback procedures to maintain trust and compliance
