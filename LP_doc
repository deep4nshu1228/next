Digital Website propensity model

Overview

Purpose: Estimate the probability that a website-origin lead will convert within a defined window so teams can fast-track high-intent leads, tailor follow-ups, and optimize offer timing and channel mix.

Decisions: Lead triage, next-best-action, and SLA targets driven by score bands and deciles for consistent, scalable execution across digital funnels.

Population and scope

In-scope: Leads generated from website forms, chat, quote/configurator requests, and identifiable high-intent sessions linked to CRM records with consent.

Exclusions: Incomplete identifiers, missing consent, obvious test submissions, and sessions outside lookback windows to preserve data integrity and compliance.

Outcome and labeling

Target: Conversion within a business-defined window (e.g., 30–60 days) using timestamped events and leakage controls; consistent definition enables comparable deciles over time.

Label quality: Audit joins between web events and CRM outcomes, ensure unique lead keys, and validate event chronology to prevent optimistic bias.

Feature design

Engagement intent: Session depth, time on site, key page views (pricing, checkout, dealer locator), return visits, micro-conversions, and abandonment points capturing latent intent.

Acquisition context: Channel/source/medium, campaign and keyword metadata, device/geo, first vs. last touch, and recency/frequency to differentiate traffic cohorts.

Form/chat signals: Field completeness, response latency, error counts, entity-intent in chat, and prior known-user status for stronger intent separation.

Model approach

Algorithms: Supervised propensity modeling for tabular data with imbalance handling; selection based on AUC, PR-AUC, lift at top deciles, and calibration reliability.

Validation: Time-aware splits with segment cuts by source/device/region and a holdout set; compare to historical baselines to set thresholds responsibly.

Score interpretation

Scale and bands: Scores 0–1 mapped to deciles and operational bands (High, Medium, Low) for clear actionability and unified reporting across channels.

Examples:

High band: Immediate callback or chat escalation, personalized offer follow-up, and suppress redundant retargeting to reduce waste.

Medium band: Structured nurture with intent-matched content, timed reminders, and selective retargeting to lift consideration efficiently.

Low band: Cost-conscious touches, light remarketing, and recycle rules to protect CPA while capturing late converters.

Performance and monitoring

Reporting: AUC/PR-AUC, lift at top 10–30%, conversion by decile, and calibration plots; segment performance informs budget shifts and threshold tuning.

Monitoring: Production vs. historical baseline for conversion by decile, lift, calibration drift, and treatment compliance; alerts trigger playbook or model updates.

Operations and refresh

Cadence: Regular model refresh incorporating new traffic patterns, campaigns, and monitoring learnings to sustain accuracy and business lift over time.

Governance: Privacy and consent controls, feature and version audit trails, and clear limitations/misuse guidance to maintain trust and compliance.

Notes on alignment

Multi-model consistency: This propensity model shares a common calibrated 0–1 scale and banding with the other use cases, enabling unified dashboards and playbooks while retaining channel-specific features for accuracy and actionability.
