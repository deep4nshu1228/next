Assumptions

Data comparability: Training and production populations remain comparable after consent filtering, deduplication, and timestamp integrity checks; no post-outcome signals leak into features used for training or scoring.​

Stationarity bounds: Feature and label distributions may drift within monitored thresholds; exceeding thresholds triggers recalibration or refresh per the lifecycle policy to preserve calibration and lift.​

Actionability and ethics: Each propensity band and time-to-convert window maps to an approved treatment; scores guide prioritization and experimentation, not deterministic approvals or denials, with privacy constraints consistently applied.​

Business inputs

Conversion horizon: 90-day conversion window is the authoritative baseline for all performance metrics, thresholds, and reporting views; any changes require governance approval.

Existing customers: For known customers, service engagement history (e.g., recent service visits, tickets, interactions) may be used as directional input to inform treatment strategies, subject to consent, privacy, and model feature policies.

Bands and SLAs: Decile cut points, time-window classes (within 3, 7, 15, 30, >30 days), and channel SLAs are owned and approved by sales/marketing to align with capacity, budget, and customer experience goals.

Exception handling

Data intake exceptions: If required identifiers, consent flags, or schemas are missing, route records to a quarantine queue; log source, timestamp, and missing fields; apply a “do not score” status unless a documented fallback exists.

Scoring pipeline errors: Guard preprocessing and inference steps; on failure, capture context and error, return a safe default (e.g., unscored status), continue batch processing, and notify the designated owner to avoid pipeline-wide halts.

Model/service fallback: If the active model is unavailable or times out, automatically degrade to the last certified version; if none is available, apply the business-defined fallback treatment for the impacted segment until restoration.

Calibration/banding invalidation: If calibration artifacts or band definitions are missing/invalid, block promotion, revert to the last valid configuration, and notify governance prior to resuming scoring.

Source/branch anomalies: On partner feed spikes, duplicate bursts, or branch outages, temporarily rate-limit or defer scoring for the affected cohort, flag for operations review, and re-enable post-validation.

Outlier treatment

Detection rules:

Statistical caps: Winsorize or cap numeric features at stable percentiles (for example, 1st/99th) to prevent undue leverage from rare extremes.

Logical validation: Remove impossible values (negative durations, future timestamps) and isolate bursty duplicates or replayed events.

Cohort checks: Monitor per-source/partner and per-branch distributions to detect localized anomalies that global rules may miss.

Channel-specific handling:

Digital non-website: Normalize extreme spend, frequency, and bid/placement metrics; cap provider-reported fields known to be noisy.

Website: Cap session metrics (time on site, pages per session) and form latency; constrain rare event counts that arise from bot or script noise.

Non-digital: Cap talk time, queue wait, and number of transfers; bound appointment counts and repeat-visit bursts for the same lead.

Operational policy:

Thresholds and alerts: Define acceptable outlier rates per feature and cohort; if breached, pause scoring for the cohort and alert owners.

Documentation: Maintain a registry of variable-level caps, imputations, and exclusion rules with effective dates and rationale to ensure reproducibility and auditability.

Validation loop: Compare model metrics pre/post-outlier treatment in holdout data; if calibration or lift degrades beyond tolerance, adjust caps or move to robust transformations rather than removal.





alculated metrics

Service engagement tier

Definition: Percentage refers to the share of minimum required services completed with Hero within the eligibility window.

Eligibility window: 12 months if no free service tier; 6 months if free service tier.

Percentage formula: Hero services completed in window ÷ minimum required services in window × 100.

Tiers:

High: ≥ 80% of required services with Hero and in-window service present.

Medium: ≥ 50% and < 80% with Hero and in-window service present.

Low: < 50% with Hero and in-window service present.

Not Engaged: Non-existing customer or no qualifying in-window service.

Distinct source and lead counts

Distinct source count: Number of unique lead sources in the period (partners, campaigns, branches, website vs. non-website).

Distinct lead count: Number of unique leads after deduplication (ID/canonical identity); report gross vs. net when needed; segment by channel/use case.
