Continuous model lifecycle

Monitoring

Track production vs. historical baseline at a fixed cadence: conversion by decile, lift at top deciles, PR-AUC/AUC, and calibration error per use case and key segments (source, region, device, branch).

Add operational checks: treatment compliance by band, time-to-first-touch, SLA adherence, and data quality signals (missingness, schema changes, volume anomalies).

Establish alert thresholds and owners: define breach levels for metric drops or drift; route alerts to model ops and business owners with recommended first actions.

Review

Weekly operational review: investigate alerts, check cohort performance, validate playbook adherence, and document quick fixes or threshold tweaks.

Monthly business review: assess budget/capacity allocation changes driven by propensity, partner/source rebalancing, and any playbook updates; confirm KPI impact against baseline.

Quarterly governance review: approve version changes, fairness/privacy checks, audit trails, and update risk notes and misuse guidance.

Model refresh

Data and features: incorporate new campaigns/partners, emerging engagement or call-center signals, and resolved data quality improvements; retire stale or unstable features.

Recalibration and thresholds: re-fit and calibrate models, re-evaluate decile cut points, and re-map action bands; backtest against the same historical baseline window for comparability.

Validation and rollout: run holdout and segment checks, pilot in shadow mode or partial traffic, document changes in a versioned model card, then promote with rollback plan.

Cadence and ownership

Cadence: monitoring daily/weekly, operational review weekly, business review monthly, governance/refresh quarterly or on-threshold breach.

Ownership: name accountable leads for analytics (metrics/drift), operations (treatments/SLAs), and governance (approvals/risks) to ensure timely actions and auditability.

Deliverables

Standard dashboard: coverage, score distribution, conversion by decile, lift vs. baseline, calibration, treatment compliance, and time-to-convert distribution.

Change log: version, date, rationale, dataset span, feature deltas, metric deltas, and rollout notes, kept alongside the model card for traceability.
