### 
Lead Propensity Models

Purpose

Predict conversion likelihood across three channels to prioritize outreach, tailor treatments, and improve marketing and sales efficiency while enhancing customer experience.

Provide calibrated scores and clear action bands so teams can fast-track high-intent leads, nurture mid-tier segments efficiently, and reduce wasted effort on low-propensity leads.

Use cases

Digital Website Leads: Score web-origin leads (forms, sessions) to enable rapid follow-up, personalized offers, and optimized timing based on intent signals.

Digital Non-Website Leads: Score paid media, aggregators, and social leads to guide budget allocation, creative optimization, and cadence by propensity segment.

Non-Digital Enquiries: Score call-center, dealership, and event leads to inform agent assignment, SLA targets, and offline nurturing strategies that balance cost and impact.

Business outcome

Higher conversion rates through priority handling of high-propensity leads and structured nurturing of medium segments, proven via lift at top deciles and calibrated thresholds.

Lower cost per acquisition by concentrating spend and human effort where uplift is measurable and scalable across channels and segments.

Faster response times and better customer experience by tying service levels, channels, and offer ladders directly to score bands and deciles.

Whatâ€™s next

Execute A/B tests by channel to quantify uplift, refine thresholds, and validate next-best-action playbooks; standardize metrics (AUC/PR-AUC, lift, calibration) for ongoing reporting.

Operationalize monitoring for data/label drift, conversion by decile, and treatment compliance; define retraining triggers and update playbooks as experiments complete.

Align dashboards to business KPIs: coverage, score distribution, conversion by decile, uplift vs. baseline, and SLA adherence to ensure clear line-of-sight to impact and accountability.
