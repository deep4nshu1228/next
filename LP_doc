Assumptions

Data comparability: Training and production populations remain comparable after consent filtering, deduplication, and timestamp integrity checks; no post-outcome signals leak into features used for training or scoring.​

Stationarity bounds: Feature and label distributions may drift within monitored thresholds; exceeding thresholds triggers recalibration or refresh per the lifecycle policy to preserve calibration and lift.​

Actionability and ethics: Each propensity band and time-to-convert window maps to an approved treatment; scores guide prioritization and experimentation, not deterministic approvals or denials, with privacy constraints consistently applied.​

Business inputs

Thresholds and bands: Decile cut points and time-window classes (within 3, 7, 15, 30, >30 days) are approved by sales/marketing owners per channel to align with capacity, SLAs, and budget.​

Playbooks: For each band/window, define channel, cadence, offers, and suppression rules; review monthly to reflect campaign mix, partner performance, staffing, and seasonal demand.​

Governance and ownership: Named owners for metrics, playbooks, and approvals; a versioned change log documents rationale, dataset span, metric deltas, and rollout notes for auditability.​

Exception handling

Data intake exceptions: If required fields, consent flags, or schemas are missing, route records to a quarantine queue; log source, timestamp, and field list, and proceed only with a documented fallback or safe “do not score” status.​

Scoring pipeline exceptions: Guard preprocessing and inference; on step failure, capture context, return a safe default, continue batch processing, and page the responsible owner to avoid pipeline-wide halts.​

Model/service unavailability: Auto-degrade to the last certified model version; if no backup exists, apply business-defined fallback treatment for the affected segment until service restoration.​

Calibration or banding errors: If calibration artifacts or band definitions are invalid or missing, block promotion, revert to the last valid configuration, and notify governance for remediation before resuming scoring.​

Partner/branch anomalies: On partner feed spikes, duplicate bursts, or branch outages, trigger protective rules—rate-limit or defer scoring for the cohort, flag for review, and re-enable post-validation.​
