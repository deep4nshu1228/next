Digital Non-Website propensity model

Overview

Purpose: Predict conversion likelihood for leads originating from non-website digital sources (paid media, aggregators/marketplaces, affiliates, social platforms, influencer and partner programs) to optimize budget allocation, creative/audience strategy, and follow-up prioritization across channels.

Decisions: Source/partner budget shifts, creative and audience refinement, lead triage and SLA targets by propensity band, and cadence selection for outreach and nurture programs.

Population and scope

In-scope: Leads captured via third-party lead providers, social ads and DMs, affiliate and influencer programs, comparison sites, and paid search/display that do not submit through the website form flow but sync to CRM with consent.

Exclusions: Duplicates across partners, incomplete identifiers or missing consent, and low-veracity sources failing quality thresholds to protect performance and compliance
