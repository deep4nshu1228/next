Business problem and approach

Problem statement

Objective: Enable data-driven prioritization and treatment of all inbound leads by predicting conversion likelihood to increase conversions, reduce cost per acquisition, and improve response SLAs under a consistent, auditable decision framework across channels.

Business pain: High and variable lead volumes with uneven intent signals create delayed responses, generic treatments, and inefficient sales effort, resulting in missed revenue and inconsistent customer experience without a unified scoring standard.

Decision supported: Lead triage (who to contact first), next-best-action selection (offer, channel, cadence), budget and capacity allocation, and SLA targets by score band to align marketing and sales execution with measurable uplift.

Success criteria: Demonstrable lift at top deciles vs. historical baseline, improved calibration and conversion by decile, faster time-to-first-touch for high-propensity leads, and lower CPA through focused effort on validated segments.

Approach

Multi-model design: Separate propensity models are maintained for each use context (Digital Website, Digital Non-Website, Non-Digital enquiries) because channels differ in data availability, feature distributions, intent signals, and operational actions, which impacts both predictive performance and business applicability.

Feature tailoring: Each model uses channel-appropriate features—for example, web engagement and session intent for site leads, source/partner and campaign attributes for non-website digital, and agent interaction and contact-center or walk-in signals for non-digital—to maximize signal and preserve actionability.

Consistent scoring framework: Despite different feature sets, all models output calibrated scores on a common 0–1 scale with deciles and operational bands, enabling unified reporting, thresholding, and playbooks across channels while retaining model-specific strengths.

Validation and baselines: Time-aware validation, segment-level evaluation, and lift vs. historical baselines are applied per model to ensure reliability; thresholds and playbooks are tuned by channel to convert predicted propensity into measurable commercial impact.
