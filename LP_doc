Final Propensity Score Calculation Logic
Identify Unique Leads

Use mobile number as the unique identifier for each lead.

A lead can come from one or more sources:

Digital

Walk-in

Telephony

Source-Based Weightage

Digital: 5%

Telephony: 5%

Walk-in: 15%

Multiple Source Handling

If a mobile number has multiple leads from different sources, then:

Find the maximum propensity score among all those leads.

Take 75% of this maximum score as the base score.

For each additional source (present for that same mobile number), add the corresponding percentage of the maximum score as per weightage.

Score Calculation Formula

Let:

P
max
P 
max
  = Maximum propensity score for the mobile number

W
digital
=
0.05
W 
digital
 =0.05

W
telephony
=
0.05
W 
telephony
 =0.05

W
walkin
=
0.15
W 
walkin
 =0.15

S
S = set of sources for that mobile number

Example

Mobile Number: 9876543210

Leads:

Digital: 0.62

Walk-in: 0.78

Telephony: 0.55
